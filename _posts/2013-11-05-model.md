I want to answer the following questions:

- What are the conditions?
- What are the organ systems, and how do conditions relate to them?
- What are the measurements, and how do they relate to the conditions?
- What are the co-morbidities, and how do they relate to the conditions?
- What are the medications, and how do they relate to the conditions?

## Organ systems

I use the following codes to relate conditions to organ systems:

- Lung (L)
- Heart (H)
- GI (G)
- Kidney (K)
- Musculoskeletal (M)
- Skin (S)
- RP/vasculature (R)

## Conditions

- Interstitial lung disease (L)
- Pulmonary arterial hypertension (L)
- Limited cutaneous disease (S)
- Diffuse cutaneous disease (S)
- Vasculopathy -- vasoconstriction (R)
- Cardiomyopathy (H)
- Scleroderma renal crisis (K)
- Esophegeal dysmotility (G)
- Gastroparesis (G)
- Deep tissue fibrosis -- tendon and muscle (M)

## Measurements

The measurements that I list below are marked with a "C" or "L" for clinical and laboratory respectively.
Listed below each measurement is a list of conditions from above that are typically assessed using the measurement.

- Skin score (C)
  - Limited cutaneous disease
  - Diffuse cutaneous disease
  - Interstitial lung disease (if skin score implies diffuse skin)
  - Deep tissue fibrosis
- Telangiectasia (C)
  - Limited cutaneous disease
  - Diffuse cutaneouus disease
  - Vasculopathy (typically associated)
- Calcinosis (C)
  - Limited cutaneous disease
  - Diffuse cutaneous disease
- Raynaud phenomenon and digital ulcerations, gangrene, or amputation (C)
  - Vasculopathy
- Nailfold capillary examination (C)
  - Vasculopathy
- ANA (L)
  - Vasculopathy
- percent FVC (L)
  - Interstitial lung disease (early decline)
- African american race (Demographic)
  - Interstitial lung disease
- Anti-topoisomerase antibodies (L)
  - Interstitial lung disease
  - Diffuse cutaneous disease
  - [overall worse prognosis]
- Tricuspid regurgitation (L)
  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension
- Prominent P2 component of S2?
  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension
- Right ventricular heaves
  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension
- Hepatomegaly
  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension
- Lower extremity edema
  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension
- Constipation (C)
  - Gastroparesis
- Malnutrition (C)
  - Gastroparesis
- GERD (C)
  - Esophegeal dysmotility
- Anti-bacterial meds
  - Gastroparesis
- Diarrhea
  - Gastroparesis
- Malabsorption
  - Gastroparesis
- RNA-polymerase III antibodies
  - SRC
  - Diffuse cutaneous disease
  - Lower risk for ILD compared to Scl-70 antibodies
- Measurements associated with severe hypertension
  - SRC
- Changes in creatinine levels
  - SRC
- Pericardial effusion
  - Cardiomyopathy
- Tendon friction rubs
  - Deep tissue fibrosis
- high-titer anti-U1-RNP antibodies
  - Mixed connective tissue disease (scleroderma features with inflammatory myopathy)
- Anticentromere antibodies
  - Limited cutaneous disease
  - Vasculopathy (severe digital ischemia)
  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension
- CT scans
  - Interstitial lung disease
- Spirometry, lung volumes, diffusing capacity (baseline and 4-12 months depending on symptoms and disease stage)
  - Interstitial lung disease (restrictive pattern can occur with or without reduction in DLCO)
  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension (isolated reduction in DLCO our of proportion to the degree of decline in FVC)
- Right ventricular systolic pressure
  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension
- Right heart catheterization
  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension (definitive diagnosis if mean RVSP >= 25 mmHg)

## Medications

- Prednisone (glucocorticoid)
  - Diffuse cutaneous disease (fibrosis)
- Methotrexate
  - Diffuse cutaneous disease (fibrosis)
- MMF (mycophenolate mofetil)
  - Diffuse cutaneous disease (fibrosis)
- Cyclophosphamide
  - Diffuse cutaneous disease (fibrosis)
- IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin)
  - Diffuse cutaneous disease (fibrosis)

## Comorbidities

- PAD (Peripheral artery disease)
  - Raynaud's phenomenon
- CAD (Coronary artery disease)
  - arrhythmias
- ASCVD (Arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease)
  - Arterial hypertension
- HTN (Hypertension)
  - Any type of hypertension measurement in the body
- Afib (Atrial fibrillation)
  - arrhythmias
- Postmenopausal
  - Hypertension?
- COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
  - Poor airflow, maybe DLCO and FVC?
- Dyslipidemia (abnormal amount of lipids in the blood)
  - Vasculature?
